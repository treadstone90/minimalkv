Create a HTTP server with get and put api. How do you plan to store arbitrary byte arrays ? Base4 encode ?
Thrift makes a lot of sense here. But we also want to practice creating a HTTO server. So lets
store a JSON Key value store.

yeah key is a String and value is a json blob.
And just expose thiss ?

Can we use an arbit key type ?
Like a long or an int. Hmm Then we need a way to take a type and then store in the KV store.
Well lets do that ?

Okay then our request is

KVRequest(key: String, value: String)

so value is a json.
and the key is base64 encoded.
The type determines how to use decode key.

KVResposnse(key: Array[Bytes], value: String)

actually lets just store JSOn and see where this takes us.
